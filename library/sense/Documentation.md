### Changing Configuration
You'll need to do this for every value you'd like to change using this method.
```lua
Sense.teamSettings.Enemy.enabled = true
```
## Sense Functions
These are our built-in functions for Sense which you can edit to give the library anything but the default information about the player.
```lua
function Sense.getTeam(player)
    return player and player.Team;
end

function Sense.getCharacter(player)
    return player and player.Character;
end

function Sense.getWeapon(player)
    return "Unknown";
end

function Sense.getHealth(player)
    local character = player and EspInterface.getCharacter(player);
    local humanoid = character and findFirstChildOfClass(character, "Humanoid");
    if humanoid then
        return humanoid.Health, humanoid.MaxHealth;
    end
end

```
## Loading Sense
```lua
Sense.Load()
```
## Unloading Sense
```lua
Sense.Unload()
```
